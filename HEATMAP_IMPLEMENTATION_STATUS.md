- ‚úÖ colourpicker added to DESCRIPTION
- ‚úÖ Version bumped to 0.1.3

## üîÑ Partially Implemented / Future Work

### GSEA Visualization Section
From the conversation summary, you mentioned:
> "speaking of directionality, it reminds me about GSEA results... can we plan to allow for heatmaps drawn using ONLY GSEA results, and for those we use the normalized enrichment score as the value to plot. we should also consider adding a section to visualize GSEA results on the same page that handles the dotplots for other enrichment test results. static plots for GSEA results can use the enrichplot package, and if you think there is some sort of interactive tool to visualize GSEA results that could be even more useful, please propose its implementation as well."

**Current Status:**
- ‚úÖ GSEA heatmaps are fully supported in the heatmap module
- ‚úÖ NES values can be visualized
- ‚úÖ GSEA-only filtering is available
- ‚ùì Separate GSEA visualization section (alongside dotplots) - NOT YET IMPLEMENTED
- ‚ùì enrichplot package integration for static GSEA plots - NOT YET IMPLEMENTED
- ‚ùì Interactive GSEA visualization tools - NOT YET IMPLEMENTED

## üìã Summary

All core heatmap functionality requested has been fully implemented and tested. The module now provides:
- Comprehensive interactive visualization
- Multiple data type support
- Advanced filtering and customization
- Publication-quality PDF export
- Proper data integration

The only outstanding item is the separate GSEA visualization section that would live alongside the dotplot module. This was mentioned as a future enhancement and would require:
1. Creating a new module (e.g., mod_gsea_viewer.R)
2. Integrating enrichplot package for static plots
3. Researching and implementing interactive GSEA visualization tools

Would you like me to proceed with implementing the separate GSEA visualization section?
